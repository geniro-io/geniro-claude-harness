# Single source of truth for the write/delete vectors a Bash-side guard cannot
# see by matching shell syntax alone.
#
# Three families live here:
#   A. `_geniro_extract_inner_payloads` — shell indirection (`sh -c`, `eval`, a
#      pipe, a heredoc, a process substitution, an interpreter shelling out).
#   B. `_geniro_interp_write_targets` / `_geniro_interp_delete_targets` —
#      interpreter-mediated file writes and deletes.
#   C. `_geniro_join_quoted_newlines` — a quoted literal spanning a newline,
#      which every line-oriented pass in a guard reads as two unbalanced lines.
#
# Every recognizer here is STRUCTURAL, not enumerative. A shell is reached by
# more spellings than a bare word — `/bin/sh` names it by path, `"sh"` quotes it,
# and `sudo` / `nohup` / `timeout 5` / `env FOO=bar` prefix it with a wrapper that
# changes only the process environment — and each spelling runs the same program,
# so ONE shell-word matcher serves every arm below. The interpreter roster and the
# write/delete op lists follow the same rule: ops are keyed on BASE names, so
# `*Sync`, a `promises.` prefix and the async variants fall out without being
# enumerated. A recognizer that models a fixed spelling is a channel, not a guard.
#
# A shell can be handed a program six ways, and only one of them is shell syntax
# the guards can match directly. `sh -c "<payload>"` and `eval "<payload>"` pass
# it as an ARGUMENT; `echo "<payload>" | bash`, `bash <<EOF … EOF` and
# `bash <(echo "<payload>")` pass it on STDIN; `os.system('<payload>')` hands it
# to a shell from inside an interpreter. In every case the guards' own passes
# destroy it before matching — quoted literals are blanked as data, heredoc
# bodies are dropped as data — so without this extraction the payload is inert
# text and the guard never inspects the command that actually runs. Each guard
# calls this BEFORE its own quote-blanking pass, then re-runs ITSELF on every
# returned payload; a block inside propagates out. Recursion terminates because
# a payload is always strictly shorter than the command it came from.
#
# Six shapes are extracted:
#   1. the sh|bash|zsh|dash|ksh|ash `-c` family — any flag cluster containing c
#      (-c, -lc, -euc), payload double-quoted, single-quoted, or bare;
#   2. `eval` followed by a quoted or bare payload;
#   3. a quoted literal piped into a shell (`echo "<payload>" | bash`,
#      `printf '<payload>' | nohup sh`) — stdin, so arms 1 and 2 never see it;
#   4. a heredoc body whose opener line invokes a shell (`bash <<EOF`,
#      `cat <<EOF | sh`) — also stdin, and the guards' heredoc scrub would
#      otherwise drop it as data. Emitted one body LINE per payload, which is
#      what the guards' line- and span-oriented matchers consume;
#   5. a quoted literal inside a process substitution a shell reads
#      (`bash <(echo "<payload>")`) — a fifth stdin channel with no `-c`, no
#      pipe and no heredoc;
#   6. the quoted argument of an interpreter's shell-out call (`os.system`,
#      `subprocess.run(…, shell=True)`, `child_process.exec*`, a Ruby backtick),
#      which is neither shell syntax nor an interpreter FILE op, so both
#      families here would otherwise miss it entirely.
#
# Usage:
#   source "$_script_dir/write-vectors.sh"
#   payloads="$(_geniro_extract_inner_payloads "$SCRUBBED" "$COMMAND")"
#
# $1 is the heredoc-scrubbed command (arms 1-3, 5 and 6 read it, so a `sh -c`
# MENTIONED inside a heredoc body destined for a file stays data). $2 is the RAW
# command, bodies intact — arm 4 needs them, and it re-derives which heredocs are
# fed to a shell rather than trusting the scrub. Omit $2 to run every arm but 4.
#
# Prints one payload per line, with one layer of surrounding quotes stripped;
# empty output when the command carries no indirection.
#
# Hooks source this with an inline fallback so a vendored install shipping
# hooks/ without lib/ still recurses — a missing helper must never make a guard
# fail open. See hooks/enforce-tdd-order.sh for the sourcing pattern. Every
# fallback is a VERBATIM copy of the function it stands in for (delimited by
# `GENIRO-VENDORED-BEGIN/END` markers); a one-sided edit here reopens the hole
# on vendored installs.

# `awk 'BEGIN{print k > ".env"}'` reach the filesystem completely unchecked.
# These two functions scan the RAW command for that channel.
#
# The op lists are keyed on BASE names (`writeFile`, `rm`, `copyFile`) with an
# optional `Sync` suffix, and the extraction drops everything left of the opening
# paren — so `fs.writeFile`, `fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.promises.rm` and
# `Deno.writeTextFileSync` are all covered without enumerating a spelling each.
# Names that collide with an ordinary collection method (`os.remove` vs
# `list.remove`, `File.delete`) stay qualified.

# Both fire only on the conjunction interpreter + write/delete op + target, so a
# read-only interpreter call (`node -e "console.log(x)"`, `awk '{print $1}' f`)
# yields nothing and stays allowed. The caller supplies the third conjunct: it
# runs its OWN path predicate over the returned targets, so a write to a path the
# caller does not protect costs nothing.
