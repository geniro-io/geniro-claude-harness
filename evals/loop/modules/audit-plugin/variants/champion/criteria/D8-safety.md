## D8 — Safety & test coverage

**Scope:** `hooks/hooks.json`, `hooks/`, `lib/`, `tests/`, `settings.json`, `cursor/hooks.json`, `cursor/hooks/`, plus `skills/` for the destructive-op-surface check only. **Method:** LLM reviewer.

Checks:
1. **Matcher coverage.** Every guard hook's `hooks.json` matcher covers ALL tools that can perform the guarded action (Edit/Write/MultiEdit/NotebookEdit; Bash variants). A guard that misses one tool is bypassable — T0. The inverse is also a finding: a matcher naming a tool or event that does not exist can never fire, so the guard silently never runs — T1; D1 seeds these.
2. **Sanitization coverage.** Every field that reaches a persisted artifact passes through `redact-secrets`; new fields added to emit paths are walked by the sanitize loop.
3. **Fail-open vs fail-closed.** For each guard: what happens when `jq` is missing, stdin is malformed, or safety.json is unparseable? Safety-critical guards should fail closed; convenience hooks may fail open — flag mismatches with the hook's role.
4. **Bypass-list integrity.** Every documented `allow_patterns` ID is actually checked by its hook; every hook bypass branch has a documented ID (CLAUDE.md + HOOKS.md).
5. **Test coverage map.** For each hook and each data-mutating lib helper: does a `tests/**` suite exercise it (both block and allow paths for guards)? Untested hard-block guards and untested live data-mutators → T1.
6. **Destructive-op surface.** Any `rm -rf`, `git push`, `--force` usage in skills/hooks/lib outside the documented guarded paths.

Tier mapping: bypassable guard / unsanitized secret path → T0; untested live mutator / wrong fail direction → T1; map gaps → T4.
